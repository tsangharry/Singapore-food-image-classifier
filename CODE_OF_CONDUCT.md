# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all apprentices at AI Singapore for Assignment 7.

A primary goal of Assignment 7 is to provide a platform to learn, build and host apps on the Tekong cluster. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

We invite all those who participate in Assignment 7 to help us create a positive experience for everyone.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

The following behaviours are considered unacceptable:

- Misuse of Polyaxon authorisation token
- Use of the Tekong cluster resources to serve applications or documents apart from the deployment of the image classification model as outlined in the `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Perform multiple API calls incessantly to apps hosted in the Tekong cluster
- Unauthorised publishing of Docker image to the registry at registry.aisingapore.net

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Warnings and instructions to cease any unacceptable actions will be issued to apprentices who misused the cluster.

Apprentices are expected to comply with the instructions immediately and inform their mentors when they have done so.
